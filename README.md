A replacement for `ls` with some special features, like tree view and Git
integration. Works as terminal program or Go library.

Inspired by [jacwah/oak][1] and [ogham/exa][2].

## Deprecated

Don't use it! I made this code trying to learn Go but I never finished it and I
don't see any reason for doing it now.
